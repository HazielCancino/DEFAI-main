# DEFAI - DeFi AI Assistant

DEFAI is a web-based AI chat application that serves as an intelligent assistant for decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions. The application provides a user-friendly interface to communicate with AI models, supporting both cloud-based OpenAI integration and local model execution via Ollama.

## Key Features:
- **Dual AI Model Support**: Switch between cloud-based OpenAI GPT-4o and local Ollama models
- **DeFi Functionality**: Built-in tools for cryptocurrency operations like balance checking, swapping, and transactions
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Modern UI built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui components
- **Web3 Integration**: Ethereum wallet connectivity for DeFi operations

## Core Functionality:
The chat interface enables users to perform various DeFi operations through natural language commands, such as checking AVAX balances, swapping tokens, sending transactions, and requesting confirmations - all powered by AI assistance.
